up to send an email if any game is at or falls below their respective price threshold.

Roadmap: [[link](./Roadmap.md)]

### Supported Storefronts
- **Steam**
- **Good Old Games (GOG)**
- **Microsoft Store (PC)**

## Quick Start
1. Setup SMTP server/service (TLS required/optional)
2. Nagivate to project folder and run `cargo build --release`
3. In the project folder, create `.env` with the following:
    ```
    STEAM_API_KEY={your_steam_api_key}
    RECIPIENT_EMAIL={destination_email_address}
    SMTP_HOST={smtp_host_domain}
    SMTP_PORT={port_number}
    SMTP_EMAIL={smtp_email_address}
    SMTP_USERNAME={smtp_username}
    SMTP_PWD={stmp_password}
    PROJECT_PATH={/path/to/game_sales_scrapper}
    ```
    - For Windows use `\\` when defining the path.

4. Add games and their respective price threshold using the [support commands](#supported-commands) below (supports commands from cargo).
5. [Optional] Automate emails (in `setup/` folder)
    - **For Unix-based systems:** Update *SCHEDULE* variable to desired execution frequency and run `set_cron.sh -c "create"` with root privileges.
    - **For Windows systems:** Update *$trigger* variable to desired execution frequency and run `set_task_scheduler.ps1 -Cmd "create"`. 
    
        If Powershell scripts execution is not enabled run the following with administrative privileges: 
        ```
        Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
        ```

## Supported Commands
Use the`--help` flag in command line to get more information on the supported commands. Here's a brief description and example of each command.
- `config` := sets what storefronts are used to search for games and enable aliases for game titles (on by default). Use `-a` to search through all supported storefronts and can be configured to be more granular. 
    ```commandline
    game_sales_scrapper config -a
    ```
- `add` := add a specified game (title must be exact to work).
    ```commandline
    game_sales_scrapper add --title <title> --price <price>
    ```
- `bulk-insert` := add multiple games with a price threshold using a CSV file.
    ```commandline
    game_sales_scrapper bulk-insert --file <file.csv>
    ```
    CSV Example:
    ```text
    games, price
    Hollow Knight, 9.99
    Cyberpunk 2077, 19.99
